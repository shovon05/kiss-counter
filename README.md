# Kiss Counter 💋

This repository is a clean rebuild of an Android-based
on-device audio event counter.

The goal is to create a reusable **core engine** that detects
kiss-like acoustic events from microphone input and counts
them reliably, independent of UI.

🚧 Status: Active rebuild (step-by-step, clean slate)

More details will be added incrementally.
