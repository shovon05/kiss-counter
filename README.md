# Kiss Counter 🎧❤️

An Android application that detects kiss-like acoustic patterns
from live microphone input and counts occurrences in real time.

## Motivation
This project explores real-time audio signal processing and
on-device machine learning for sound event detection.

## Core Features (MVP)
- Live microphone input processing
- Acoustic feature extraction (MFCC)
- Lightweight ML-based sound classification
- Kiss event counter (local only)

## Tech Stack
- Android (Kotlin)
- AudioRecord API
- TensorFlow Lite
- Python (model training)

## Privacy
- No audio is recorded or stored
- All processing happens on-device
- Only acoustic features are analyzed

## Status
🚧 Planning & Dataset Preparation
