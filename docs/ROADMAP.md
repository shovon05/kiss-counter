# Roadmap

This project is being rebuilt intentionally in small steps.

Planned phases:
1. Repository reset & structure
2. Define core kiss-counting engine (UI-agnostic)
3. Audio capture & permissions
4. Feature extraction & inference interface
5. Counting logic & lifecycle handling
6. Example Android UI (replaceable)
7. Documentation & build instructions
